# Microsoft and GitHub Accounts

## Purpose

You will need a Microsoft account and a GitHub account for the class. These accounts are used to connect each person to their Azure DevOps teams. We need both accounts because a Microsoft account alone does not always work.

## Email Address

Create the two accounts using your temporary email account (coffeeshopcode.com). Please, DO NOT use your work email, personal email or any other Microsoft or GitHub accounts that you may have. We want to keep everything consistent for everyone in the class.
