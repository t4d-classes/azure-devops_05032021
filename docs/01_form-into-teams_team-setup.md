# Team Setup Instructions

## Welcome!

We are super excited to have you in this Creating Microsoft DevOps Solutions class! Because of the nature of this class there is a fair amount of setup and teardown needed at the start of the week and the end of the week.

At the start of the week, we are going to configure a myriad of services to use with our Azure DevOps projects. Some of these services will require creating accounts and a few of the services will require one member of the team to enter a credit card number (although you will not be charged any money).

Because we have a large class divided into many teams, we will be using software such as WebEx and Slack to easily communicate when the whole class is together and when the class is divided into breakout rooms.

## Setup and Teardown

The morning of the first day will be challenging and everyone's patience will be required. It will take a while to get all of the teams up and running. Thank you ahead of time for your understanding.

On the last day of class, the instructor will use the last hour of class to help teams teardown and clean up. Once each team is done, they will be free to go.

## Email Accounts

Because you will need to sign up for services such as Slack that limit access based upon email address domain names, we have provisioned you with a temporary email account using the following pattern.

If you work email is:

```text
Bob.Smith@somecompany.com
```

Your temporary email account will be:

```text
Bob.Smith@coffeeshopcode.com
```

This email account forwards to the work email address we were provided with. You may use this temporary email account for all of the accounts created in the course. For Slack, you must use this account in order to connect into our Slack instance.

This temporary email account will be deleted after class is over.

## Credit Cards

To create accounts for services such as Azure and SonarCloud a valid credit card is needed. One person the team will need to volunteer to use their card. No charges should be posted to the account and it is preferred to have one person use their credit card for both services.

Please email me the name of the person(s) who entered their credit cards. I will work with them on last day to ensure accounts are cancelled and no charges are made to their cards.
