# Slack Setup

## Personal Slack Account

Each person needs a Slack account to communicate with their team, the instructor, and the class a whole.

Please visit this link, and create a Slack account with the temporary email provided you in the class. PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR WORK EMAIL AS THIS WILL NOT CONNECT TO OUR CLASS INSTANCE.

Click here to register and sign in: [https://slack.com/signin](https://slack.com/signin)

In the textbox below the "OR", type in your temporary email address and follow the steps. The Slack client is already installed on your lab machine.

After creating a Slack account, record the password.

## Team Slack Channel

Each team will need to create a Slack Channel with the following name pattern: `Team<#>-<YOUR_TEAM_NAME>`

For example, if you are team 2, and your team decides to be called the CodeBots, you Slack Channel name would be: "Team2-CodeBots"

Please invite only your team members and the instructor to your Slack Channel.

## Slack Warning

While we use Slack for class on the class computers, please remember that your organization may not approve of using Slack to discuss work-related matters. Please limit Slack conversations to things related to the class.

## When to use Slack

- Use Slack for all chatting in the class. The instructor will not be paying attention of the WebEx chat tool
- Use Slack for chatting with the whole class and within your team
- Please feel free to private message the instructor and other students on class-related matters
- Finally, when you are in the breakout rooms the only way to contact the instructor to join your room is via Slack, so please use Slack to ask the instructor to join you
