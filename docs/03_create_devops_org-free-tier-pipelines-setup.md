# Azure DevOps Pipelines

## Free Tier Policy Change

Due to a [recent policy change](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/change-in-azure-pipelines-grant-for-private-projects/) with Microsoft they are not automatically granting free tier access to their private pipeline services. Instead, after an organization is created, an [email needs to be sent to Microsoft requesting free tier access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs?view=azure-devops&tabs=ms-hosted). This email needs to be sent as part of the setup process on Monday morning.

## Request Free Tier Access

It takes them a day or two to grant access. If a team sends the email and access is not granted by the time we need it, for any reason, then let the instructor know immediately. If you recieve an email from Microsoft asking for extra details, please let the instructor know ASAP. We want to reply as fast as possible.

After creating the team's organization in Azure DevOps, have the team leader send the following email to Microsoft at `azpipelines-freetier@microsoft.com`. Please copy the instructor on the email.

Hello,

My name is <YOUR NAME HERE>. I am taking a class on Azure DevOps and my team's DevOps Organization requires access to the Azure Pipelines Free Tier to run build and release pipelines for the class projects. We need this access as soon as possible to complete the lab exercises for the class.

Here is our information:

My name: <YOUR NAME HERE>
DevOps Organization URL: <YOUR DEVOPS ORGANIZATION URL>

Thanks,
<YOUR NAME HERE>
```

## Plan B, If Plan A Fails

Yes, the instructor has a plan B if Microsoft does not grant access. But let's do all we can to ensure we get free access.
